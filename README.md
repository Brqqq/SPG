# SPG

Subreddit Picture Grabber is a little tool that lets you specify a series of subreddits. It will then download images from that subreddit and make it your wallpaper. You can specify which subreddits it should use and how often it should retrieve a new wallpaper.

## Settings

In the 'options.js' file, you may specify which subreddits to use and how often it should retrieve a new wallpaper

## Running

It requires at least NodeJS v6.10.2. Some previous versions might work, as long as it supports most ES6 features.
Run 'node app.js' to start the application
